## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```


```{r ex20220517}
library(sf)
library(raster)

library(tmap)    # for static and interactive maps
library(leaflet) # for interactive maps
library(ggplot2) # tidyverse data visualization package



data0 <- st_read("class/data/JPN_adm/JPN_adm1.shp")
plot(data0)
data0
data1 <- raster("class/data/JPN_msk_alt/JPN_msk_alt.vrt")
data2 <- raster("class/data/JPN_msk_pop/JPN_msk_pop.vrt")
plot(data1)
map_jpn <- tm_shape(data0) + tm_borders() + tm_fill()
breaks = c(-5, 0, 5, 10, 20, 30, 40) * 100
#map_jpn1 <- map_jpn + tm_shape(data1) + tm_raster(alpha = 0.7, n = 10, palette = "OrRd")
map_jpn1 <- 
  map_jpn + tm_shape(data1) + tm_raster(title = "Japan elevation" ,alpha = 0.7, breaks = breaks)
map_jpn1
#map_jpn2 <- map_jpn + tm_shape(data2) + tm_raster(alpha = 0.7)
#map_jpn2

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
